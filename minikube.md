Setting up Minikube with GPU support is a great next step. Here's a guide to set up Minikube with GPU support on your Windows machine using WSL2:

First, ensure Minikube is installed in your WSL2 environment. If not, install it:
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment (which you've already done).
Start Minikube with GPU support:
minikube start --driver=docker --container-runtime=docker \
  --docker-opt gpus=all \
  --addons=nvidia-gpu-device-plugin \
  --kubernetes-version=v1.26.3
This command:

Uses the Docker driver (compatible with WSL2)
Enables GPU support
Adds the NVIDIA GPU device plugin
Specifies a Kubernetes version (adjust as needed)


Verify GPU support in Minikube:
minikube ssh -- nvidia-smi
This should display your GPU information.
Enable the metrics-server addon for HPA to work:
minikube addons enable metrics-server

Apply your Kubernetes manifests:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

Verify the deployment:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl get hpa

To access your service, you can use:
minikube service sentiment-analysis-service
This will provide a URL to access your service.

Additional notes:

Your deployment.yaml looks good for GPU support. It's requesting 1 GPU per pod, which is correct.
The hpa.yaml is set up to scale based on CPU utilization. If you want to scale based on GPU utilization, you'll need to set up custom metrics.
The service.yaml looks fine for basic NodePort access.

Remember, Minikube is running inside WSL2, so you're essentially running a Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual environment. Performance might not be the same as a bare-metal setup, but it's great for development and testing.
